# Sprint Wars Backend - Team 4

Project Lead: Kenneth Fujimura
Backend Team: Dan Decoito, Carlos Felipe
Frontend Team: Elizar Garcia, Jeremy Lapham, Richard Johnson

This webapp is a fullstack project that is intended to work in tandem with the website "Codewars". In it, a team can have an admin user issue katas for regular users. The users can mark those as complete so the admins can keep abrest of the progress of their users.

This repository is the frontend code of the site. It is designed to be deployed to Azure and to host the user-facing side of the site that people will see when they visit the site through a web browser. You can create users (username must be the same as your pre-existing codewars username), login, and depending on if you're an admin or a regular user - see all the other users and assign katas to users, or see all the katas you've been assigned and then keep the record of if you've finished them or not.
